VERY GOOD!!!
This project isn't terribly impressive...
...
It is a combination of scripts following gamesplusjames tutorials, like this one: https://youtu.be/ehmBIP5sj0M
The tile map was made using the "Tiled Editor" 
The sprites on sceen are a modification of a sheet found on Open Game Art [LPC_Terrain].
Image attribution is included in the project on github, but original image credit goes to Lanea Zimmerman (AKA Sharm).
The skybox in the background comes from a free Unity Asset Store download called, "PurpleNebula."
The tilemap was imported using "Tiled2Unity" Copyright (C) 2014 Sean Barton under MIT License.
This is my first Unity sandbox project, using the free Unity Personal edition version 5.5.0f3

You can use WASD to pan around the map, or try plugging in a controller!
