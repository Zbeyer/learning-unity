The Spectrum... A world of divided light... An adventure for the eons.
Atop his throne, the evil emperor Myddaz loomed... His armor of overlapping metal plates hummed and rored as they vibrated, rotated, and oscillated.
His many badges pulsed with powerful forces... He was great and terrible!
He was beloved by his nation, but he was a serpent of deciet.
Arrogant, prideful, cunning, and wicked to the core... Myddaz The Beast of War! The Mighty Hunter, the man of woes...
The hero had survived many perilous times, now armed only with his wits—he would vanquish evil once and for all...
Ah, the Spectrum. It's been ten years since we first dreamed you... Will the builders ever give you life?
